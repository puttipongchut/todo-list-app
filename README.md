# My Todo List Web Application âœ¨

My First Fullstack App that I built, A simple and minimal Todo list app that features a full CRUD on the Database.
This project was built for my own learning goal : learning backend development, basic Postgres queries and implementation.

Tech Stack : React (Vite) + TailwindCSS + Express.js + Node.js + PostgreSQL (Docker Image)
